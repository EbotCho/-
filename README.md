# Dong-a_Univ. Enhanced forecasting of electricity demand for apartment buildings based on weather conditions 
## The First Preliminary Project of IITP

## Background of Project
 <br>Electricity is a commodity that must be consumed at the same time as it is generated. 
If the demand for electricity is overestimated, overinvestment in power generation facilities may occur, 
and if it is underestimated, there is a greater chance that the power supply will be insufficient and unstable. <br>

 The importance of forecasting becomes even more important as it is becoming more difficult to predict electricity demand 
 due to the intensifying extreme weather in recent years. 
it is expected to prevent damages such as power outages caused by insufficient power supply 
and financial losses caused by excessive power supply..<br><br>

## The goals of the project
 <br>The primary goal of this project is to create a model that 
 predicts the electricity demand of apartment buildings based on climate data and electricity demand data.
 
 In addition, we hypothesize that extreme weather caused by global warming will increase misprediction, 
 and apply deep learning to the designed model to improve the model and reduce the cost of misprediction.<br>

 As a secondary goal, we aim to combine trendy technologies (generative AI, image detection...) 
 with insights from the primary goal to create and study useful services.  <br><br>
